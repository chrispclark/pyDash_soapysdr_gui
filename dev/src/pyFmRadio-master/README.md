What
--------------

This is my personal exploration into Python coding, RTL-SDR development, and fm demodulation.  Any SDR supported by the RTL-SDR project is supported.

Currently the receiver demodulates a stereo FM signal (left & right).

The code works with Python2.7 and following libraries
- SciPy
- NumPy
- portaudio and pyaudio for audio playback
- rtlsdr and pyrtlsdr for interfacing with the SDR
